Assignment: Electricity Consumption Data Analysis with NumPy
Problem Statement

You are provided with electricity consumption data (in kWh) for a household measured daily over 4 months (120 days).
The daily consumption values range between 200 kWh (minimum) and 600 kWh (maximum).

Your task is to simulate the dataset using NumPy and perform an in-depth analysis of the household’s electricity consumption.

Tasks (Do all 10)

Generate the Dataset

Use numpy.random.randint() to simulate 120 daily consumption values between 200 and 600 kWh.

Store the data in a NumPy array called consumption.

Basic Statistics

Calculate the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of daily consumption.

Identify Extremes

Find the day number(s) with the highest and lowest consumption.

Monthly Splitting

Divide the dataset into 4 months (30 days each).

Store each month’s data in a separate NumPy array.

Monthly Analysis

For each month: calculate the total consumption and average daily consumption.

Weekly Analysis

Reshape or split the data into weeks of 7 days (ignore the extra 4 days at the end).

Compute the weekly totals and weekly averages.

Overall Consumption Trend

Calculate the cumulative consumption across the 120 days.

Display the first 10 values of the cumulative sum.

Moving Average

Compute a 7-day rolling average using np.convolve to smooth out fluctuations.

Display the first 10 values of this rolling average.

Anomaly Detection

Define anomalies as days where consumption is 2 standard deviations above or below the mean.

Identify the day numbers that are anomalies.
